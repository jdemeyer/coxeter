This is the README file for Coxeter version 3.0.64

This file mostly contains practical hints for the compilation and installation
of the program. For a detailed overview of the program, its capabilities and
limitations, see the INTRO file.

The program needs access to help files and to Coxeter matrices. The
locations of these files are described in directories.h. The default
setting is that they are in the directory where the program is being
executed.

In order to access most of the "help" for individual commands, you
should first pick a Coxeter group (by typing "type" and then (for
instance) "A" and "1".  Then type "help" and the name of a command.

Debugging is enabled by default; to avoid this (and make the program
run much faster) say "make optimize=true".
